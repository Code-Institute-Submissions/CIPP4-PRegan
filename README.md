# PianoPhiles

PianoPhiles is a blog site for piano lovers where they can share clips of their favourite performances, post questions about technique or interpretation, or share pictures of their fun piano moments. As well as being able to share content in text, image and video format, users can discuss the material with other likeminded keyboard enthusiasts through comments, show their appreciation with likes and add a personal touch to their own profile page with a short bio and profile photo. Let's get tinkling those keys!

- Site Goal

  - The goal of the site is to create a place where piano lovers can really sink their teeth into their favourite arguments about the art. Spaces like pianostreet used to thrive in the early days of popular widespread internet, but due to their lack of design and ui development, that community has fizzled out and is nowhere near as active as it used to be. It would be nice to resurrect that fun community online where people had ridiculous arguments about interpreting Chopin.

- Target Audience

  -Users of the site are likely to be advanced second level and conservatoire level student pianists and retired amateur pianists; a reflection of the real life piano recital going audience.


- Is the content relevant?

This content is ultimately frivolous, but there I do believe there is a genuine desire for discussion among musicians, and in the Instagram age, what's not to enjoy about the press campaigns of our favourite stars?

- Must Have
The project must have:
    - A home page displaying new posts related to the piano.
    - Login/logout functionality allowing users to maintain anonymity if they so choose.
    - Commenting functinonality so that users can discuss their views.
    - A database that stores user data securely.
    - Video hosting capability.
    - Text hosting capability.
    - Image hosting capability.

- Should Have

    - Profile functionality where users can choose whether or not to share information about themselves, and where they can access their history of activity,     
    notifications etc.
- Ability to like posts.
- Dynamic like button.

- Could Have
    - Live chat feature.

### Structure Plane

As per the requirements of Code Institute's Portfolio Project 4 assignment, this functions at the most basic level as a CRUD application.

C - Users can create profiles, comments and posts.
R - Users can read the profiles, comments and posts of other users. They can read their own comments and posts.
U - Users can edit their profiles.
D - Users can delete their past comments, posts and their profile.

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!
